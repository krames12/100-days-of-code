# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some planning by forking the repo and thinking about what to work on through the duration.

**Thoughts:** I like to at least attempt to plan out a loose guide for what to do during any sort of journey or trip. I do have a mini-deadline on a personal project to update and a few other lists of things to possibly use as well. Updating my first public project, [PugCheck](http://pugcheck.com), so that it supports the newest World of Warcraft raid coming out in a couple of weeks is very high on that list. I am working towards becoming employed as a front end dev and I have a few other projects that I'd like to create for the purpose of learning new frameworks and ways of doing things and boosting up my portfolio a bit.

**Link to work:** No actual work done as of yet.
